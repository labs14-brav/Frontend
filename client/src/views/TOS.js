            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
            <h3>Thanks for using Brāv.</h3>
            <p>Please read these Terms carefully. By using Brāv or signing up for an account, you’re agreeing to these Terms. This is a legal agreement. We’ll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand this agreement. Brāv (“Brāv” or the “Service”) is an conflict managing service offered through the URL www.brav.org (aka “Website”) that allows you to among others, train, manage, and vote on various conflicts of yours or other individuals. Brāv is owned and operated by NGM, LP d/b/a Brāv, a Michigan limited partnership (“Brāv,” “we,” or “us”). Brāv has employees, independent contractors, interns, volunteers and representatives (“our Team”). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you’re a “Member” according to this agreement (or “you”).
            These Terms of Use (“Terms,” including our Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, API Guidelines, Copyright Policy and Brand Guidelines) define the terms and conditions under which you’re allowed to use Brāv, and how we’ll treat your account while you’re a Member. If you have any questions about our terms, feel free to contact us.
            ACCOUNT</p>
            <h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
            <p>In order to use Brāv, you must:
            be at least eighteen (18) years old (or have written consent by a legal guardian if a minor) and able to enter into contracts;
            complete the registration process;
            agree to the Terms; and
            provide true, complete, and up to date contact information.
            By using Brāv, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won’t use Brāv in a way that violates any laws or regulations. (Representing and warranting is like making a legally enforceable promise.) Brāv may refuse service, close accounts of any users, and change eligibility requirements at any time.</p>
            <h3>2. Term</h3>
            <p>The Term begins when you sign up for Brāv and continues as long as you use the Service. Clicking the button and entering your username means that you’ve officially “signed” the Terms. If you sign up for Brāv on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.</p>
            <h3>3. Closing Your Account</h3>
            <p>You or Brāv may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving Notice to the other party. We may suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. We refuse to refund any amount - this includes no perforated portions or any prepayment, and this includes if we terminate your account with or without cause. Instead, we may at our discretion reimburse you for unused conflict management Credits, but only if requested within ten days of termination. In addition, we won’t refund or reimburse you if there is cause, like a violation of these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy. Once terminated, we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with it, including your conflict managements from our Website. If you don’t log in to your account for 12 or more months, we may treat your account as “inactive” and permanently delete the account and all the data associated with it.</p>
            <h3>4. Changes</h3>
            <p>We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms of Use on our Website and/or by sending an conflict management to the last conflict management address you gave us. Unless you terminate your account within seven (7) days, the new Terms will be effective immediately and apply to any continued or new use of Brāv. We may change the Website, the Service, or any features of the Service at any time.</p>
            <h3>5. Account and Password</h3>
            <p>You’re responsible for keeping your account name and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any account that you have access to, whether or not you authorized the use. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only reset your password.</p>  
            <h3>6. Account Disputes</h3>
            <p>We don’t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of your personal and/ or professional relationships, and we don’t arbitrate disputes over who owns an account. You won’t request access to or information about an account that’s not yours, and you’ll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who owns an account based on the content of the conflict managements in that account, and if multiple people or entities are identified in the content, then we’ll rely on the contact information listed for that account.
            PAYMENT</p>
            <p>7. Monthly or Annual Plans
            Our charges for one time,  monthly or annual plans are posted on our Website and may be changed from time to time. If any part of a month is included in the Term, then payment is due for the full month. Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day you made your first monthly payment (the “Pay Date”). If you go over your sending limit and reach another pricing level, then you’ll have to pay at the higher level on or before the next pay date. If the Term ends before that payment is due, you’ll still be required to make one payment at the higher level.</p>
            <h3>8. Pay as You Go Plans</h3>
            <p>You may buy conflict management Credits to use our Services instead of signing up for a monthly plan. This is explained on the pricing page of our Website. If you choose a Pay as You Go Plan, you’ll still be considered a Member, and other than the monthly payment requirement, all the terms of this Agreement will still apply to you. conflict management Credits for Pay as You Go accounts roll over and don’t expire, but if your account is inactive for more than 12 months, it may be deleted.</p>
            <h3>9. Credit Cards</h3>
            <p>As long as you’re a User/ Member or have an outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid debit and/ or credit card information and authorize us to deduct the regular (ie/ daily, weekly, monthly, annually, etc) charges against that debit and/ or credit card. You’ll replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a valid one. Anyone using a debit and/ or credit card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that debit and/ or credit card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that debit and/ or credit card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process your debit and/ or credit card order, we’ll try to contact you by conflict management and suspend your account until your payment can be processed.</p>
            <h3>10. Refunds</h3>
            <p>You are not entitled to a refund from us under any circumstance. Instead, we may offer Credit towards one service if a User/Member applies for one only if there was absolutely no use of your service and only if requested within seven days of the particular issue, which must be identified and dated within the request.</p>
            <h3>11. Charges for Add-Ons</h3>
            <p>Some features are offered as add-ons to your Brāv account. If you add on a feature that has a charge, then you’ll be billed that additional amount with each billing cycle for as long as the add-on is active. Some add-ons, including the training, are intended for particular use cases and may have additional terms or restrictions (“Additional Terms.”) If you use an add-on in a way that violates these Terms or the Additional Terms, then we may terminate your account. If you use us, in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, then we may charge you at the comparable Brāv pricing tier or terminate your account.</p>
            <h3>12. Billing Changes</h3>
            <p>We may change our fees at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our Website and/or sending you a notification by email or other means.
            RIGHTS</p>

            <h3>14. Proprietary Rights Owned by You</h3>
            <p>You represent and warrant that you either own or have permission to use all of the material in your conflict managements. You retain ownership of the materials that you upload to the Service. We may use or disclose your materials only as described in these Terms and our Privacy Policy. You agree that any and all services may be recorded and retrieved at any time.

            <h3>16. Right to Review conflict management Campaigns</h3>

            <p>We may view, copy, and internally distribute content from your conflict managements and account to create algorithms and programs (“Tools”) that help us spot problem accounts.

            <h3>17. General Rules</h3>

            You will not harass and/ or abuse others using the site as defined by U.S. Department of Security.

            <p>If you think anyone is violating any of these Terms, please notify us immediately. If you received spam you think came from a Brāv user, please report it to our abuse team. (The best way to tell whether an conflict management was sent through Brāv is that every Brāv campaign has an embedded Campaign Tracking ID in the header that makes it easy to report suspected spam.) If you think anyone has posted material that violates any copyrights, then you can notify us according to our Copyright Policy.</p>
            <h3>19. Bandwidth Abuse/Throttling</h3>
            <p>You may only use our bandwidth for your Brāv conflict managements.

We may throttle your sending or connection through our API at our discretion.</p>
            <h3>20. Compliance with Laws</h3>
            <p>You represent and warrant that your use of Brāv will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

You may not use our Service for any unlawful or discriminatory activities, including acts prohibited by the Federal Trade Commission Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or other laws that apply to commerce.</p>
            <p>If you’re located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or send to anyone in the EEA, you represent and warrant that in training, seeking to have a conflict managed, sending communication via Brāv, and collecting information as a result of sending communication, you:
            Will clearly describe in writing how you plan to use any data collected, including for your use of Brāv. You’ll get express consent to transfer data to Brāv and be processed, and you’ll otherwise comply with whatever privacy policy you have posted.</p>
            <p>Have complied, and will comply, with all regulations, as well as data protection, electronic communication, and privacy laws that apply to the countries where you’re sending any form of communication through Brāv.</p>
            <p>Have collected, stored, used, and transferred all data relating to any individual in compliance with all data protection laws and regulations. You have the necessary permission to allow Brāv to receive and process data and send communications to that individual on your behalf.

            <h3>37. No Changes in Terms at Request of Member</h3>

Box 36081 Grosse Pointe, MI 48236, or any addresses as we may later post on the Website.</p>
            <h3>41. Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>These Terms, our Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, API Guidelines (all of which are incorporated into these Terms by reference), and any additional terms you’ve agreed to by turning on specific features (“Additional Terms”) make up the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements, representations, and understandings.

            <h3>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction </h3>
            <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by Brāv’s Choice of law or the laws of the State of Michigan without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights will be the state and federal courts located in Brāv’s Choice of Law/ Jurisdiction or Michigan and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p> 
            <h3>Entire Agreement</h3> 
            <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Brāv and you regarding the Site, Services and Collective Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Brāv and you regarding the Site, Services and Collective Content.</p> 
            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Brāv’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Brāv may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.

            Dispute Resolution </p>
            <p>You and Brāv agree that any and all conflict and/ or dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding mediation and/ or arbitration only, and that you do not retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Brāv are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Brāv otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms. Any legal dispute with Brāv must be resolved through a private mediation or arbitration process out of public view and requires all cases to be brought individually.</p>
            <h3>Fees</h3>
            <p>You agree to be charged fees to extend the use of Brāv service(s) if the deadline expires or time lapses. This may occur for any Brāv service, including but not limited to Brāv training, Brāv sessions(s), Brāv voting, etc.</p>
            <h3>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law </h3>
            <p>The arbitration will be administered by the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (“CPR”) in accordance with the Commercial ADR Rules then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The ADR Rules are available <a href='http://cpradr.org/Resources/ADRTools/ADRRulesEthicsCodes.aspx'>here</a> or by calling CPR at 212-849-6490.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p> 
            <h3>Arbitration Process </h3>
            <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a notice of arbitration as specified in the CPR Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Brāv's choice of law and will be selected by the parties from the CPR’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the notice of arbitration, then the CPR will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the CPR Rules.</p> 
            <h3>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3> 
            <p>Unless you and Brāv otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Brāv submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the CPR Rules. Subject to the CPR Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p> 
            <h3>Arbitrator’s Decision</h3> 
            <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the CPR Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Brāv will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p> 
            <h3>Fees </h3>
            <p>Your responsibility to pay any CPR filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the CPR Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Brāv will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p> 
            <h3>Changes </h3>
            <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Brāv changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to info@brav.org) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Brāv’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Brāv in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p> 
            <h3>General</h3> 
            <p>The failure of Brāv to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Brāv. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
